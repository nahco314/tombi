# tombi-extension-cargo

Tombi is written in Rust, and we want to make the Rust development experience even better ðŸ¦€

Experimentally, we provide additional features when editing `Cargo.toml` files.

## Supported Features

### Go to Definition
For example, suppose you have a `Cargo.toml` like the one below:

#### Go to workspace/crate definition from `dependencies`
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
tombi-ast = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Definition" will navigate you to the **workspace** definition or to the **crate** definition managed by the workspace.

In the example above, for `serde` (an external crate), you'll be navigated to the **workspace** definition, while for `tombi-ast` (a crate managed by the workspace), you'll be navigated to the **crate** definition.

<Note>
If you consistently want to navigate to the **workspace**'s `Cargo.toml`, use "Go to Declaration".
</Note> 

#### Go to crate definition from `workspace.dependencies`
```toml
[workspace.dependencies]
tombi-ast = { path = "crates/tombi-ast" }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `path`, executing "Go to Definition" will navigate you to the crate definition.

### Go to Declaration
```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { workspace = true }
tombi-ast = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Declaration" will navigate you to the crate definition.
