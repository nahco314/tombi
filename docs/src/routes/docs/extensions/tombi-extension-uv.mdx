# tombi-extension-uv

Tombi provides enhanced features for Python projects using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), making Python development experience even better üêç

Experimentally, we provide additional features when editing `pyproject.toml` files.

<Warning>
Since uv is a third-party library and is provided by Tombi at its arbitrary discretion,
please use it as an experimental feature with the understanding that support may be discontinued in the future.
</Warning>

## Supported Features

### Go to Definition
For example, suppose you have a `pyproject.toml` like the one below:

#### Go to package definition from `dependencies`
```toml
[project]
name = "albatross"
version = "0.1.0"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["bird-feeder", "tqdm>=4,<5"]

[tool.uv.sources]
bird-feeder = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Definition" will navigate you to the the **package**'s `pyproject.toml` managed by the workspace.

<Note>
If you consistently want to navigate to the **workspace**'s `pyproject.toml` where the workspace is defined, use "Go to Declaration".
</Note>

### Go to Declaration
```toml
[project]
name = "albatross"
version = "0.1.0"
dependencies = ["bird-feeder", "tqdm>=4,<5"]

[tool.uv.sources]
bird-feeder = { workspace = true }
```

In this case, when your cursor is on `workspace`, executing "Go to Declaration" will navigate you to the workspace definition in the **workspace**'s `pyproject.toml` file.
